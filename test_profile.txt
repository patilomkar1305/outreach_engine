PERSONAL
When I'm not coding, you'll find me hiking in Marin County, experimenting with espresso (amateur barista!), or contributing to tech education initiatives. Big believer in work-life balance and building inclusive engineering cultures.

RECENT ACTIVITY
Just finished reading "Team Topologies" - totally changed how I think about org design. Currently working on a blog series about migrating monoliths to microservices. Excited about the future of WebAssembly and edge computing!

COMMUNICATION STYLE
I keep things casual and straightforward. No corporate jargon - I prefer real conversations over polished pitches. Always happy to grab coffee with fellow engineers or collaborate on interesting problems.
