Marcus Blackwell
Principal Security Consultant at CyberShield Advisory
London, UK | Cybersecurity Consulting

ABOUT ME
I help enterprises secure their infrastructure against evolving threats. 15+ years in offensive security, penetration testing, and security architecture. CISSP, OSCP, and CEH certified with hands-on experience across finance, healthcare, and critical infrastructure sectors.

Before consulting, I spent time in government cybersecurity roles (details limited due to NDAs). Now I split my time between client engagements, security research, and speaking at conferences like Black Hat and DEF CON.

PERSONAL
I maintain a low public profile but am active in security communities under various handles. I contribute to open-source security projects and occasionally publish research papers. Outside of security, I'm into rock climbing and chess.

RECENT ACTIVITY
Currently focused on cloud-native security challenges – seeing a lot of misconfigurations in Kubernetes and serverless deployments. Just wrapped a major incident response engagement for a fintech client. Researching supply chain attacks and SBOMs.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
Be direct and technically competent. I don't have patience for security vendors who lead with fear-mongering or buzzwords. If you're reaching out, understand my domain, reference specific challenges I care about, and demonstrate technical credibility. Technical white papers > marketing decks.
