Senior Product Designer at Pixel & Code Agency

ABOUT ME
I'm a product designer who lives at the intersection of beautiful aesthetics and thoughtful UX. At Pixel & Code, I work with startups and mid-size companies to design web and mobile experiences that users actually love.

I'm self-taught (shoutout to YouTube, Dribbble, and way too much trial and error), and I've been designing professionally for 7 years. I geek out over animation, design systems, and accessibility – and I'm always experimenting with new tools.

  Lead designer on 15+ client projects (web, mobile, SaaS)
  Built design systems for 3 high-growth startups
  
• Product Designer, Findery (2019-2022)
  Designed core app features, ran user research, iterated based on data
  
• Freelance Designer (2017-2019)
  Worked with 20+ clients on branding, web, and product design

• UI/UX design & interaction design

• User research & usability testing
• Accessibility (WCAG standards)
• Motion design & micro-interactions

PERSONAL
Super active in the design community – I share work-in-progress shots on Twitter/X and Dribbble almost daily. I also run a small YouTube channel where I do design critiques and tool tutorials (12K subs and growing!).

RECENT ACTIVITY
Just finished a redesign of a health-tech dashboard that I'm really proud of. Currently learning Three.js to add more depth to web experiences. Thinking a lot about AI tools for designers – I've been testing Figma AI, Midjourney, and other tools to see how they fit into my workflow.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
Casual and visual! If you're reaching out, show me something cool – a design, a product demo, a prototype. I respond way better to "hey, check this out" than formal pitches. I'm active on Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram, so DMs work great. Just be genuine and creative ✨
