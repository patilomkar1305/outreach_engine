Patricia O'Brien
Procurement Manager at MidAmerica Healthcare Network
Chicago, IL | Healthcare / Hospital System

ABOUT ME
I manage procurement operations for a 12-hospital healthcare network, overseeing $450M in annual spending across medical equipment, supplies, pharmaceuticals, and services. It's my job to negotiate the best prices while maintaining quality and ensuring regulatory compliance.

I've been in healthcare procurement for 19 years – started as a buyer, worked my way up through category management, and now lead a team of 18 procurement professionals.

EXPERIENCE
• Procurement Manager, MidAmerica Healthcare Network (2015-Present)
  Managing procurement across 12 hospitals, 65+ clinics
  Achieved $23M in cost savings through strategic sourcing initiatives (2022-2025)
  
• Category Manager - Medical Devices, Northwestern Medicine (2010-2015)
  Managed $120M spend category, consolidated vendor base by 40%
  
• Senior Buyer, Advocate Aurora Health (2005-2010)
  Responsible for surgical supplies and capital equipment purchasing

INTERESTS & EXPERTISE
• Strategic sourcing & supplier relationship management
• Contract negotiation & vendor management
• Healthcare GPO (group purchasing organization) strategy
• Inventory management & supply chain optimization
• Cost reduction & value analysis
• Compliance (FDA, HIPAA, regulatory requirements)

PERSONAL
I'm practical and process-oriented. Not particularly active on social media – email and phone are my primary communication channels. I attend AHRMM (healthcare supply chain) conferences annually for professional development and vendor engagement.

RECENT ACTIVITY
We're currently going through an ERP implementation (switching to Oracle), which is consuming a lot of bandwidth. Also conducting an RFP for medical-surgical supplies. Constantly evaluating new vendors for cost savings opportunities while maintaining our quality and service standards.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
I'm professional, no-nonsense, and very busy. If you're a vendor, please understand that I get 20+ cold calls and emails per day. To stand out: tell me exactly what you're offering, what makes you different, why I should consider a change from my current supplier, and what the total cost looks like (not just unit pricing). References from other healthcare systems are essential.
