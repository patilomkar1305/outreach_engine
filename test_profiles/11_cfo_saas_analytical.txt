Austin, TX | SaaS / Cloud Computing

ABOUT ME
I'm the CFO at RapidScale, a $200M ARR cloud infrastructure company that's scaling fast. I oversee finance, accounting, FP&A, and investor relations as we prepare for our eventual IPO (hopefully 2027!).

CPA and CFA charterholder. Previously VP Finance at Twilio during their hyper-growth phase, and before that I was in investment banking at JPMorgan covering enterprise software.

PERSONAL
I'm selective about my time and communication channels. Email is best – I generally don't engage much on social media, though I do maintain a LinkedIn presence for professional networking.

RECENT ACTIVITY
Currently implementing NetSuite to replace our aging financial systems. Hiring a Head of FP&A and building out our accounting team ahead of SOX compliance requirements. Evaluating billing and subscription management platforms – our current solution doesn't scale.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
I'm analytical, data-driven, and ROI-focused. If you're pitching a solution, I need to see: pricing transparency, implementation timeline, integration requirements, and customer references from similar-stage companies. I appreciate brevity and substance over style. Get to the point quickly.
