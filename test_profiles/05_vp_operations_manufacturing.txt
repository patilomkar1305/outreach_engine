Robert "Bob" Sullivan
VP of Operations at Precision Manufacturing Inc.
Detroit, MI | Industrial Manufacturing

ABOUT ME
I've been in manufacturing for 28 years, and I've seen this industry go through some major transformations. At Precision Manufacturing, I oversee 4 facilities, 850 employees, and $120M in annual production for the automotive and aerospace sectors.

Started as a process engineer right out of college and worked my way up. I'm old-school in some ways – I believe in walking the factory floor every day – but I'm also a pragmatist who knows we need to modernize to stay competitive.

PERSONAL
Not active on social media – LinkedIn is about as far as I go. I'm straightforward and don't have patience for sales theatrics. Outside of work, I coach Little League and restore classic cars (currently working on a '67 Mustang).

RECENT ACTIVITY
We're in the middle of evaluating new MES and ERP systems – our current setup is from 2009 and it's showing its age. Also looking at automation solutions for our welding line. Dealing with ongoing skilled labor shortages and training challenges.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
I prefer phone calls or face-to-face meetings over endless email chains. If you're selling me something, I need to know: what problem it solves, how long implementation takes, what the ROI timeline looks like, and who else in our industry is using it successfully. References matter.
