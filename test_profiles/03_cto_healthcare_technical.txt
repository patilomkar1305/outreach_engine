Chief Technology Officer at MedLink Health Systems
Boston, MA | Healthcare Technology

ABOUT ME
I lead technology strategy and engineering at MedLink, where we're building HIPAA-compliant infrastructure for interconnected healthcare systems. My background is in distributed systems, cryptography, and healthcare informatics.

PhD in Computer Science from MIT (thesis on privacy-preserving medical data exchange). Previously led platform engineering at Epic Systems and spent time at the Broad Institute working on genomic data pipelines.

EXPERIENCE
• CTO, MedLink Health Systems (2021-Present)
  Leading 120-person engineering org, overseeing architecture for 500+ hospital network
  Built FHIR-compliant API serving 15M patient records
  
• VP Engineering, Epic Systems (2017-2021)
  Led interoperability team, implemented HL7/FHIR standards
  
• Research Scientist, Broad Institute of MIT & Harvard (2014-2017)
  Developed secure computation protocols for genomic research

INTERESTS & EXPERTISE
• Healthcare data interoperability (FHIR, HL7, DICOM)
• Privacy-preserving computation & federated learning
• Cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP) with healthcare compliance
• Clinical decision support systems
• Machine learning for diagnostic imaging
• Zero-trust security architecture

PERSONAL
I publish regularly in academic journals and speak at conferences like HIMSS and IEEE. Active contributor to open-source healthcare projects. Outside work, I mentor women in tech and volunteer with Code.org.

RECENT ACTIVITY
Currently standardizing our microservices architecture and evaluating new encryption methodologies for patient data. Published a paper on federated learning in healthcare at NeurIPS. Recruiting senior backend engineers with healthcare domain expertise.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
I appreciate technical depth and precision. If you're pitching a solution, I need to understand the architecture, security model, and compliance approach. No hand-waving – show me the technical documentation, reference implementations, and performance benchmarks.
