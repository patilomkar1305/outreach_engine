Raj Krishnan
Senior Machine Learning Engineer at DataWorks AI
Bangalore, India | Artificial Intelligence / ML Platform

ABOUT ME
I build production ML systems that actually work at scale. At DataWorks, I'm part of the ML platform team – we provide the infrastructure that powers recommendation engines, fraud detection, and predictive analytics for our enterprise clients.

MS in Computer Science from IIT Delhi, specializing in deep learning and natural language processing. I'm a regular contributor to TensorFlow and PyTorch, and I've published several papers on distributed training and model optimization.

EXPERIENCE
• Senior ML Engineer, DataWorks AI (2021-Present)
  Building horizontally scalable ML platform serving 200+ models in production
  Reduced model training time by 60% through distributed training optimizations
  
• ML Engineer, Flipkart (2018-2021)
  Built recommendation and search ranking systems processing 100M+ daily requests
  
• Research Intern, Google Brain (Summer 2017)
  Worked on neural architecture search and AutoML

INTERESTS & EXPERTISE
• Deep learning (CNNs, Transformers, LLMs)
• MLOps & model deployment (Kubeflow, MLflow, SageMaker)
• Distributed training & model parallelism
• Feature engineering & data pipelines (Spark, Airflow)
• Model monitoring & observability
• Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX

PERSONAL
Very active in the ML community – I write technical blog posts on Medium, contribute to open-source projects, and mentor through MLH. I'm on Twitter/X sharing research papers and discussing ML trends. Also love cricket and playing CTF challenges.

RECENT ACTIVITY
Currently fine-tuning LLMs for domain-specific applications and exploring prompt engineering techniques. Just published a blog post on efficient inference optimization. Looking into vector databases for RAG applications. Experimenting with quantization and model compression.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
I'm friendly but I appreciate technical substance. If you're reaching out about an ML tool or platform, show me the technical docs, GitHub repo, or live demo. I want to understand the architecture, performance benchmarks, and how it integrates with our stack (we're heavily Python/PyTorch-based). Happy to chat on LinkedIn, email, or even Twitter DMs if it's something technically interesting!
