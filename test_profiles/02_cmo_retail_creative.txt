Jasmine "Jazz" Rodriguez
Chief Marketing Officer at FreshThreads
Los Angeles, CA | Fashion & Retail

ABOUT ME
Hey! 👋 I'm Jazz, and I'm obsessed with building brands that actually resonate with Gen Z and Millennials. At FreshThreads, we're not just selling clothes – we're creating a movement around sustainable, inclusive fashion that doesn't compromise on style.

I started my career at Nike doing digital campaigns, then went agency-side at Wieden+Kennedy before joining the startup world. Best decision ever! Now I get to break all the traditional marketing rules and have fun doing it.

PERSONAL
Obsessed with my rescue dog Luna 🐕, trying every new coffee shop in LA ☕, and binge-watching reality TV (don't judge!). I'm super active on Instagram and LinkedIn – slide into my DMs if you've got something cool to share!

RECENT ACTIVITY
Just wrapped our biggest campaign yet with Emma Chamberlain. Working on launching our first physical retail space in Venice Beach. Hosting a podcast about modern brand building – "No Filter Marketing" – check it out!

COMMUNICATION STYLE
Keep it real! I hate corporate speak and formal emails put me to sleep 😴. Talk to me like a human. Show me something creative, unexpected, or genuinely useful. Bonus points for good memes and authentic energy.
