I'm deeply rooted in my community and spend most of my time either at work or volunteering. Active in my church and on the board of two local education nonprofits. I maintain a professional presence on LinkedIn.

We just launched our first career accelerator program focused on tech careers – partnered with Google and Microsoft for the pilot. Currently in the middle of our annual fundraising campaign (aiming for $2M). Writing a lot of grant proposals and cultivating relationships with corporate sponsors.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
I'm warm but mission-focused. If you're reaching out about a partnership, donation, or service that could help our students, I'm all ears. Be clear about the value you can provide to our mission. I care deeply about measurable impact and sustainability. Authenticity and shared values matter more to me than flashy presentations.
