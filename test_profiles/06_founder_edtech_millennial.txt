Maya Patel
Co-Founder & CEO at LearnLoop
San Francisco, CA | Education Technology

ABOUT ME
I dropped out of Stanford to build LearnLoop, and we're now helping 500K+ students learn math through AI-powered adaptive tutoring. I'm passionate about democratizing education and making learning actually enjoyable (wild concept, I know! 😄).

Before this, I was a product manager at Khan Academy and taught middle school math through Teach For America. Those experiences showed me how broken the traditional education model is – and how much potential there is to fix it.

PERSONAL
Huge advocate for mental health in the startup world – I openly talk about founder burnout and therapy. Love hiking, terrible at meditation (working on it!), and I make a mean Thai curry. Very active on Twitter/X and Instagram.

RECENT ACTIVITY
Just launched our AI tutor feature and the response has been incredible! Currently hiring our first Head of Growth. Writing a lot about the intersection of AI and education – recently published an op-ed in EdSurge. Fundraising for Series B starting in Q2.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
I'm casual, curious, and I love connecting with people who are genuinely passionate about what they do. Definitely don't send me a formal "Dear Ms. Patel" email 😅. Tell me something interesting, share what you're building, or ask me a thoughtful question. I'm always down to chat with fellow founders and ed-tech folks!
