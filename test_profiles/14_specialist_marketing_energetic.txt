ABOUT ME
Hey! I'm Tyler, and I run digital marketing for GreenPath Solar. We're a residential solar installation company operating across Colorado and Utah, and I'm responsible for driving leads through SEO, paid ads, content, and social media.

I'm 27, been in digital marketing for 4 years (started right out of college at a local agency), and I'm loving the growth trajectory in the solar industry. It's awesome to work for a company that's genuinely making a positive environmental impact!

PERSONAL
Pretty active online – I'm on LinkedIn, Instagram, and Twitter/X. I follow a bunch of marketing influencers and I'm always testing new tactics. Outside of work I'm into mountain biking, craft beer, and fantasy football. Huge Avalanche fan!

RECENT ACTIVITY
Just finished a major landing page redesign that improved our conversion rate by 18% 🎉. Currently experimenting with YouTube ads for the first time. Trying to figure out how to better track offline conversions (phone calls → closed deals). Also looking into marketing automation tools beyond what HubSpot offers.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
Super casual and friendly! I'm always down to connect with other marketers or check out cool tools/platforms. If you're reaching out with something marketing-related, just be real with me – show me how it works, what results I can expect, and pricing (I don't have enterprise budgets, so keep it realistic for a growth-stage company). Bonus points if you can show me a quick Loom demo or case study!
