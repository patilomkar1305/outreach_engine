Alex Park
Director of Sales at VelocityAI
Remote (based in Austin, TX) | B2B SaaS

ABOUT ME
I'm building the sales org at VelocityAI from the ground up! We're an AI-powered sales intelligence platform (yes, I see the irony of getting cold outreach 😂), and I'm all about that hustle.

Came up through the SDR→AE→Manager track at Salesforce, then jumped to a growth-stage startup (Segment) before landing here. I love the scrappiness of early-stage – we're 25 people, just raised our Series A, and moving FAST.

EXPERIENCE
• Director of Sales, VelocityAI (2024-Present)
  Building sales team from scratch - currently at 8 reps, targeting 15 by Q3
  $3.2M ARR, growing 30% QoQ
  
• Sales Manager, Segment (2021-2024)
  Managed enterprise AE team, averaged 140% quota attainment
  
• Account Executive, Salesforce (2018-2021)
  Top 10% performer, closed deals from $50K-$500K ARR

INTERESTS & EXPERTISE
• Sales playbook development & go-to-market strategy
• Outbound prospecting (yes, I still carry a number)

• Team coaching & rep development
• Product-led growth & freemium conversion

PERSONAL
Poker player, fantasy football addict, and BBQ enthusiast. I'm highly responsive on LinkedIn and email – I live in my inbox. Recently started a newsletter about sales leadership in startups.

RECENT ACTIVITY
Just hired our first sales enablement person! Experimenting with AI SDR tools (for research purposes, obviously). Looking to optimize our demo-to-close conversion rate. Also trying to figure out if we should go upmarket or expand into mid-market faster.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
Be direct, be concise, and get to the point. I get 50+ cold emails a day – if yours doesn't hook me in the first sentence, I'm out. Show me you understand my challenges. If you're selling something, tell me ROI and implementation timeline upfront.
