PERSONAL
I'm in hospitality because I genuinely love creating memorable experiences for people. It's a demanding industry – I'm often working evenings, weekends, and holidays – but incredibly rewarding. I network primarily through industry associations like AHLA and local hospitality groups.

RECENT ACTIVITY
We're in the middle of a major renovation – updating all guest rooms and the lobby (opening in phases to minimize disruption). Currently evaluating new PMS and guest engagement platforms. Also exploring sustainability initiatives – our guests increasingly care about environmental practices.

COMMUNICATION STYLE
I'm warm, relationship-focused, and customer-service oriented. If you're reaching out about a product or service, I want to understand how it improves the guest experience or operational efficiency. I care about integration with our existing systems, ease of staff training, and what kind of support you provide. I prefer initial contact via email, with follow-up calls once I've had a chance to review.
